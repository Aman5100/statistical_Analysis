Project Title

US Customer Insights – Statistical Analysis & Visualization

Objective:

1)To analyze customer demographic and behavioral data using descriptive statistics, visualization, and statistical hypothesis testing.

2)To identify spending patterns, customer segments, and relationships between variables such as age, gender, education, marital status, and engagement behavior.

3)To generate actionable business insights that can help in customer targeting and retention strategies.

Tools & Libraries Used:

1)Python

2)Pandas – Data loading, cleaning, aggregation, and statistical summaries

3)NumPy – Numerical computations

4)Matplotlib – Basic data visualization

5)Seaborn – Advanced statistical visualizations

6)SciPy (stats) – Hypothesis testing and correlation analysis.


Key Analysis Performed:

1)Data overview using info(), describe(), and missing value checks

2)Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for key numerical features

3)Distribution analysis using histograms and boxplots

4)Categorical analysis using count plots and cross-tabulation

5)Relationship analysis using scatter plots and KDE plots

6)Correlation analysis between numerical variables.


Hypothesis testing:

1)T-test for spending difference between genders

2)ANOVA for spending differences across education levels

3)Chi-square test for marital status vs number of pets

4)Pearson correlation for age vs customer engagement.


Outcomes & Insights:

1)Majority of customers fall in the 30–45 age group, which is the most active spending segment.

2)Monthly spending varies significantly by education level, confirmed through ANOVA testing.

3)No strong gender bias in spending, as indicated by the t-test results.

4)Older customers tend to have higher days since last interaction, showing lower engagement.

5)Spending behavior differs across states, indicating potential for region-specific marketing strategies.

6)Marital status and number of pets show a measurable association based on the chi-square test.
